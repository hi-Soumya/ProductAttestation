# EThGlobal-ProductAttest

Project Idea: Decentralized Marketplace Verification for Instagram Sellers

**Problem**: Trust issues exist when buying products through social media platforms like Instagram. Buyers are often uncertain about the legitimacy of sellers and the authenticity of products.

**Solution**: Build a decentralized application where Instagram sellers can create verifiable attestations of their products using **Sign Protocol**. Buyers can then verify these attestations to ensure they are purchasing from legitimate sellers with authentic products.

# Sign Schema Implemented:
[{"name":"instagramAccountHandle","type":"string"},{"name":"productName","type":"string"},{"name":"attestationId","type":"string"}]

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
